![Application Architecture](https://github.com/PavanKumarMadduri/Multi-Container/blob/master/Elastic%20Bean%20Deployment.png?raw=true)

## CI/CD Pipelines 

Implemented a full CI + CD workflow using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, created a pipeline that automatically deploys code every time you push the latest changes to Github!

## Multi-Container Deployments on AWS!

After building the deployment pipeline, the code will be tested for both Single Container and Multi-Container deployments on AWS.  The multi-container application is constructed utilizing Node, React, Redis, and Postgres, and is deployed on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and Elastic Container Service (AWS ECS).
