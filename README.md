# Build, Test, and Deploy Docker applications with Kubernetes on GCP

## Why Kubernetes

The problem with multi-conntainer application scaling using AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## CI/CD Pipelines 

Implemented a full CI + CD workflow using Github, Travis CI, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), created a pipeline that automatically deploys code every time you push the latest changes to Github!

## Deployments on Localhost using minikube

## Deployments on GKE - Application Architecture GKE!

After building the deployment pipeline, the code will be tested and deployed on GKE. The application is constructed utilizing Node, React, Redis, and Postgres, and is deployed on GCP using GKE
